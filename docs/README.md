# h2 Concept
With the 'We're NOT Special' installation, you leave your unique silhouette on the screen. This way, everyone who passes by can leave their mark, creating a collective work of art that embodies inclusivity. Because inclusivity is important in society, this interactive multimedia installation shows that everyone is unique in their own way, yet we are all just people, and one is not better than the other. </br> </br>

# h2 Used software
We used the following languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
We also used the following libraries and modules: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, Time en Pygame </br> </br>

# h2 The code
* Disclaimer: I had never used Python before, so I had to rely on YouTube tutorials and ChatGPT. *

I started my project with the following tutorial: Body Segmentation Tutorial. This tutorial is about body segmentation. After following the tutorial, you will have a code that segments your body silhouette.

The video does not show you how to download Python or the necessary libraries, so I will.

Step 1: Download Python from this site. I recommend version 3.8, 64-bit.

Step 2: Create a virtual environment. It is good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. By doing so, you create an isolated environment and ensure your project remains unaffected by changes made to other projects. To create a virtual environment, open the terminal and type:
![piece of code: python -m](/public/myenv.png)
<code style="color : aquamarine">python -m venv myenv</code>
